## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lesson | k-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering | [Here](./clustering-starter.ipynb) |
| Solution  | Solution code for questions and exercises | [Here](./solution-code/clustering-solution.ipynb) |
| Datasets | Beer nutrition and cost | [Here](./data/beer.txt) |
| Extra Practice | Four additional labs for practice | [Here](./practice/) |

**Rapid Schedule:** For a half-lesson, consider only covering k-means. If additional time is needed, the k-means metric explanation could be skipped.

This lesson uses a small beer dataset describing beer name, calories, sodium content, alcohol percentage, and cost. This data set is ideal because it is easy to read it all and clusters into identifiable categories.

## Learning Objectives
- Determine the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Demonstrate how to apply k-means clustering.
- Demonstrate how to apply density-based clustering (DBSCAN).
- Define the Silhouette Coefficient and explain how it relates to clustering.
